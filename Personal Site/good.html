    <h2> Professional History </h2>
    While completing my university degree I have had several summer and part-time positions.  From May 2013-April 2015 I was a student employee with ATCO Gas in their Integrity Engineering department.  I worked full time in the summers and part time during school.  The projects I worked on focussed on data analysis and database management.  From May to August of 2015 I was an Intern for Wipro Technologies Australia in their Enterprise Applications group.  I participated in a SAP upgrade testing process, and implemented a OpenText controlled document workflow system, allowing business users to automatically manage the controlled document review process.
